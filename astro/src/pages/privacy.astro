    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="lead">Last updated: December 2024</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Prompt Loop is a local-first skill development app. Your privacy is important to us, and we've designed the app to keep your data on your device.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Data Collection</h2>
      <h3>What We Collect</h3>
      <p>Prompt Loop is a <strong>local-first application</strong>. All your data is stored locally on your device:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Skills data</strong> - Your skills, sub-skills, and progress</li>
        <li><strong>Tasks</strong> - Practice tasks and completion records</li>
        <li><strong>Practice sessions</strong> - Session history and notes</li>
        <li><strong>Settings</strong> - App preferences and configurations</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>What We Don't Collect</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We do not collect, transmit, or store your personal data on any servers</li>
        <li>We do not track your usage or behavior</li>
        <li>We do not share your data with third parties</li>
        <li>We do not use analytics or tracking services</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>LLM Integration</h2>
      <p>The app offers two modes for AI assistance:</p>
      
      <h3>Copy-Paste Mode (Default)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You manually copy prompts to external LLM services (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)</li>
        <li>You paste responses back into the app</li>
        <li>The app never connects to any external services</li>
        <li>Your data stays on your device</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) Mode</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You provide your own API key for OpenAI or other providers</li>
        <li>Your API key is stored securely in your device's secure storage</li>
        <li>The app connects directly to the LLM provider using your credentials</li>
        <li>We never see, store, or have access to your API keys</li>
        <li>Your prompts and responses go directly between your device and the LLM provider</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Important:</strong> When using BYOK mode, your data is subject to the privacy policy of your chosen LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.). We recommend reviewing their policies.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Data Storage</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>All data is stored in a local SQLite database on your device</li>
        <li>API keys (if provided) are stored in secure device storage using platform-specific secure storage</li>
        <li>No data is synced to cloud services</li>
        <li>No backups are created outside your device</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Permissions</h2>
      <p>The app requires minimal permissions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage</strong> - To save your local database</li>
        <li><strong>Internet</strong> (optional) - Only required if using BYOK mode for LLM integration</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
      <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You can delete all data by uninstalling the app</li>
        <li>You can clear specific data through the app's interface</li>
        <li>There is no data to delete from our servers because we don't have any</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
